when it came out of the oven, 10 people were standing in my kitchen, and they sort of collectively gasped.  one of our (non-family) guests asked, ""where did you get that turkey?  and what did you do to it?  it looks like something out of a magazine!""  :)

to my absolute delight, it tasted as good as it looked!  everybody said it was the juiciest, most flavorful turkey they'd ever eaten.  so, yeah, ""flipping the bird"" works even when it's the big bird!

i baked 2 pieces at a time on baking paper on an oven tray. each batch took just long enough to cook, that i had two more ready to swap when the first ones were done.

the cream filling (and coating) is made from sour cream and sugar. the sour cream is simply whipped with the sugar until the sugar dissolves. the original recipe said to add sugar ""by intuition""; i think you're supposed to keep adding more until it thickens, but the time i tried that it was too sickly sweet!

i have also made the filling/coating using fresh cream - 750ml, soured with 1/2 cup lemon juice and beaten until just starting to thicken (you still use the sugar & honey). this was for a vegetarian who pointed out that the cultured sour cream i used had gelatin in it. a slightly different taste, but a very nice variation.

i personally don't like walnuts all that much, so i leave them out whenever i cook this.","['eggs', 'sugar', 'baking soda', 'liquid honey', 'margarine', 'flour', 'sour cream', 'honey', 'plain sweet biscuit crumbs', 'ground walnuts']",10

this recipe is butter-basted white bread; i got this from a book in the library, i cannot remember the title or author.
i make this bread for my mother and friend who cannot have gluten in their diet.  they rave that this is better than the small store loafs and love that it cuts without crumbling and ideal for sandwiches, toast etc, they both prefer the 1 white/1 brown rice flour mix with linseed and sunflower seeds for taste and texture.  
the minimum setting i have on my bread machine is 4 hours, the bread cooks fine on this for me.
