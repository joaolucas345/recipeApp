giving, why should my salad get off easy? the result is beautiful to look at and  impressed everyone, plus they raved about my decades-old \"secret\" dressing.  quantities of the vegetable toppings are based on using one large head of iceberg lettuce and standard sized bowl, but i've used iceberg and other salad greens in larger quantities by increasing amounts of vegetable toppings so top is not \"half dressed\"! (quantities of fresh veggies for \"rings\" are fairly approximate because salad bowls vary in sizes, but rings should be uniformly shaped)\r\ndon't be afraid to try this -- it's not as complicated as it may seem!\r\n\r\nre. secret dressing: the recipe makes a good amount, so can be enough for larger salads.  it really is a closely-guarded recipe given me by my cousin, who was friends with a chef who swore her to secrecy. however, i think since my promise of secrecy was made over 30 years ago, the statute of limitations has run out! he worked at one of the first very exclusive $$ spa resorts in southern california that still exists... the golden door.  at that time it was the first dressing i had ever had with fresh ginger and i had to drive miles to an asian market to find it and the rice vinegar... times have changed! similar dressings now exist, so i'm sure the spa now has a totally different \"secret\" dressing!","ingredients":"['salad greens', 'green onions', 'salt', 'pepper',

serve up at superbowl. its sooo tasty and really easy. plus because you eat it with tortilla chips as a dip kids love it. not to mention the fact that it is really versatile. the leftovers make great

crushed tomatoes because they use a lower processing temperature in the canning process and therefore are fresher tasting than other brands.  recipe notes:  according to the chefs, grating the onions instead of chopping allows them to carmelize more quickly. the butter is used because saturated fats helps the onions stay sweet. olive oil contains  unsaturated fats that react with an enzyme in the onion that can result in a bitter taste. using crushed tomatoes is preferable to other forms. the chefs apparently expended a great deal of effort in developing this simple recipe so it is suggested

so) to bake hot and fresh. they also say whole grain spelt can be substituted. in addition, they offer more recipes, photos, videos, etc. at www.healthybreadinfive.com. i would just like to mention that the cookbook is great for the wealth of background information and a huge variety of recipes. it's great to read, so even if you find the recipes you like online, if  you have even a little

loaf (perfect as a side to a homey soup) you can add oats. also, ground flaxseed makes a healthy addition of omega-3 fatty acids, as well as an extra dose of fiber. this bread is not too dense, but comes out soft enough for sandwiches and freezes extremely well. it makes awesome toast for any toast lovers too!","ingredients":"['water', 'yeast', 'egg', 'salt', 'honey', 'applesauce', 'whole wheat

buy the 13 bean soup mix in the bulk section of my supermarket.  it contains the 13 varieties of dry beans as follows:  baby limas, large limas, garbanzo, great northern, black-eyed peas, navy, black, red pinto, red lentils, green lentils, yellow splits, green splits,  and kidney beans.  even my toddler had fun eating this soup.  it was almost like watching a kid sort their m&m candies into colors!  we took the opportunity to teach her the name of each bean as she picked it out to eat.  be sure to plan ahead, as the beans need to soak overnight or for 8 hours before cooking.  (cook time noted includes soaking time.)  *update december 2011:  since hosting the january 2011 soupfest tag game in the topic of the month forum i have been using sharon123's recipe for homemade herb & garlic broth (link in ingredients section) instead of just plain water as the soup base.  it's absolutely delicious and so easy to make and store in the freezer.  feel free to use that recipe or any other broth for some or all of the water in the soup (not for soaking the beans).","ingredients":"['soup mix', 'water', 'ham', 'leeks', 'garlic cloves', 'carrots', 'celery', 'basil', 'thyme',

college (this is a cheap dinner to make and easy to double good for big families). all i had on hand was chicken and rice and mushroom soup. lucky i had a few spare items on hand. i didn't like the idea of chicken just sitting there in cream of mushroom soup for an hour in the oven with rice. so i tweaked it with white wine and made it on the stovetop we couldn't wait an hour. with the brown bits it made the greyish looking soup into a pretty golden color and the garlic woke everything up. the uncle ben flavor rices are awesome--when you're in a pinch i totally recommend them. you can also use egg noodles--it makes it a bit more richer. ever since then, i get this request about twice a week and people still don't believe its cream of mushroom soup--who knew

so that i don't have to hook out the book every time.  the dough is stored in the fridge for up to 2 weeks, taking out a bit each day as you need it, forming it and baking it.  a forum i belong to love this bread, which is what inspired me to get the book.  most of them cook it in a remoska, which is a gadget that i find invaluable.  remoska's are from checkoslavakia, and i believe they've just come to the states.  in the uk they're available from \r\nstrongly recommend getting the book, if you like this bread.  they have lots of different kinds of bread which you make in this way (also sweet ones), plus ideas on how to ring the changes, recipes to use up the stale bread, etc.  ps  someone said they were having difficulty getting hold of the book, so i tried to post an amazon link for it here.  but it just comes out as html gobbledey gook!  if anyone knows how to do it, please let me know.  otherwise, try amazon, guys :-)   very, very worth getting the

necessary to cover the entire base of the pan with garlic, but the chicken should rest on garlic heads.  you could fill the rest of the pan bottom with celery, carrots and potatoes to roast along with

is served with a delicious butterscotch sauce for a decadent twist! moreover, all the family can now have their pudding and eat it, as this appeals to all ages! steaming a pudding is so easy - you just pop it on to gently steam, whilst you prepare the rest of the festive meal. you only have to remember to keep topping up the water from time to time. serve warm with the hot butterscotch sauce and maybe a jug of single cream or brandy custard to help it along! merry christmas! n.b. this recipe was taken from the christmas 2003 edition of bbc good food magazine, i have amended it slightly to personal taste. i have made this pudding every year since i first saw the recipe, and i have given this recipe out countless times!","ingredients":"['raisins', 'sultana', 'self-raising flour',

8, for family portion size. make however big or small of a batch you may need. for the 32 burgers, i purchased the following: 8 lbs of 80/20 ground beef @ $2.19/lb ($17.52), 1 lb bacon @ $3.49/lb, 2 - 8oz blocks of cheese @ 2/$4.00, 2 heads of iceberg lettuce @ $0.69/ea ($1.38), 4 large tomatoes @ $0.49/ea ($1.96), 4 - 8ct pkgs of buns @ $0.89/ea ($3.65). my grand total was $32.00 exactly! the key to this is to buy everything when it is 'on sale', and \"freeze it\"!!! (okay, you can't freeze the veggies, but all else you can). i hope this recipe comes in handy for anyone wanting to feed a crowd. and it sure beats the \"value meal\" burgers, and these are so much better! i created this (on very short notice), to feed to a group of 30+ men that were staying at a local church for the evening. they loved the burgers, so i was happy. i hope you

woodman, monsieur jacquot, has a small chateau with several vineyards, and every year we are invited to join in on the first or last day of the \"vendange\" - the grape harvest. and, every year, madame jacquot prepares and cooks the most delicious food for all of the grape pickers, family and invited friends. this year (2009) the harvest started on the 1st october, and this is the dish she made for us, served simply with fresh salads, assorted local breads, local butter, cheese and of course local wine, pineau and cognac. i asked her for the recipe and she rattled out the ingredients at a rapid pace, whilst i scribbled them down on the back of an envelope!  i have recreated this recipe at home twice now, and this is almost as good as hers is! (mind you, she set hers out on long tables with white linen and beautiful old vintage crockery.......i found out that the white linen were bed sheets! never used on a bed she stressed, kept for large gatherings.) the key to this recipe is simplicity and good sausages and wine. i used local toulouse sausages, meaty and with a high 85% meat content. but you can use any good, meaty sausages that you have available locally - i bet high quality venison or angus beef sausages would be brilliant in this dish. also, do try to source “lentilles vert de puy” – green puy lentils; they make all the difference to this wonderful harvest dish. i hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we did, sitting at the long table in the old barn, under ancient beams and with beaming faces and loud laughter.

bay leaf and rosemary.  some fresh scallions to garnish, and i prefer to serve mine over mashed \"spuds.\" mashed potatoes are the perfect comfort food to me; however butter noodles or rice could also
